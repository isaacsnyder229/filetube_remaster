## 🏷️ Tag System

The **first tag** always represents the **creator** of the pack.  
Available tags:

- **Texture**
- **Skin**
- **World**
- **Movies**
- **APKs**

There isn’t a dedicated **Mash-up** tag since those are split into their individual components.  
For example, the *Festive Mash-up 2016* is divided into three separate files: **Skins**, **World Template**, and **Texture Pack**.  
You can still search for “Mash-up” since all related files include that term in their names (copied directly from the Marketplace).

## 🎬 Movies, Shows & Anime

A new tab has been added for **movies**, **shows**, and **anime**.  
If you’d like something added, feel free to suggest it — I’ll try to upload the highest-quality version available.
